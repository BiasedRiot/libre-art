# libre_art
This project is used as a basic template for sharing art designs with [the Copyleft principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft). The pictures and project files in this repo are free to use, edit, distribute and change as laid out in the GNU licence.

Restrictions on the use and improvements of Art are ludicrous and should not be taken seriously given that credit to the original creator is observed. Unfortunately due to the copyright system that exists in the west this is the case. The solution to this is to adopt and use Copyleft licenses instead and to observe the same principles of free software to all digital media.

Inside the Examples folder you will find both design templates as well as the source projects used to create them.
